        <p>
          I first visited Grainne Adams after a family bereavement and I suppose like many people I was not totally convinced that homeopathy would be for me. I can only say I was wrong. Grainne and her remedies have changed my life completely for the better. Since first visiting her I have achieved things I never thought possible, and now feel positive and happy in my everyday life. I will be forever grateful to Grainne for all that she did for me.

        <p>
          Grainne listens carefully to every word, and takes her time to understand where the client is coming from. I've been a regular client for over 4 years now, and if Grainne Adams comes across a problem which she herself cannot address, then she knows a woman or man who can help. As a therapist, Grainne leaves me feeling in charge of my health, and she gives me all the support I need to live a healthy life.

<!-- What is Homeopathy Section -->
<section class="homeopathy-info">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>What is Homeopathy?</h2>
      <p>
        Homeopathy is a system of medicine that has been practised all over the world for almost 250 years. Homeopathic remedies work at an energetic level, stimulating the body's own healing abilities to help mental, emotional, and physical ailments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word homeopathy is derived from Greek meaning 'similar suffering'. This is the basis of homeopathic philosophy. The main philosophy of homeopathy teaches that a substance that can produce symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms in a sick person. For example, a remedy made from a red onion is often prescribed for somebody suffering with red, itchy eyes that water constantly, similar to the condition hay fever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our bodies are always trying to maintain balance but sometimes our immune system is weakened. This can be due to various stresses that we encounter in our everyday lives or due to the stress that our lifestyle puts on our bodies. Whenever we are out of balance we can be guaranteed that our immune system will be trying to restore the balance to help us regain health. Homeopathic remedies are in such minute, dilute doses that they are safe for everybody to use from infants, pregnant women to elderly people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Homeopathic remedies act as a catalyst to stimulate the body‚Äôs own immune system to heal. As the remedy will match the symptoms of the person it‚Äôs as if it points the immune system in exactly the right direction to speed the healing process and to restore health and wellbeing to the body.
      </p>
      <p>
